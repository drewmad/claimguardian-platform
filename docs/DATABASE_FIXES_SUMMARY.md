# Database Fixes Summary

## Completed Fixes via MCP ✅

### 1. Created Missing Tables
- **policy_documents**: Table for storing insurance policy document metadata
- **document_extractions**: Table for AI-extracted data from documents  
- **learnings**: Table for Claude Learning System to store AI improvements

### 2. Created Missing Views
- **policy_documents_extended**: View joining policy_documents with extractions
- **recent_login_activity**: View showing login activity from last 30 days

### 3. Created Missing Functions
- **search_learnings**: Function to search AI learnings by task type, language, framework

### 4. Fixed RLS Policies
- **user_profiles**: Fixed policies to use correct column name (user_id instead of id)
- **policy_documents**: Added proper RLS policies for user document access
- **learnings**: Added policies for authenticated access

### 5. Added Missing Columns
- Added to user_profiles: first_name, last_name, email, x_handle, is_x_connected

## Still Need Manual Action ⚠️

### Storage Bucket Creation
The storage bucket for policy documents needs to be created manually. Run the script in Supabase Dashboard:

```bash
# Location of fix script
/Users/madengineering/ClaimGuardian/scripts/fix-storage-bucket-policies.sql
```

Steps:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Copy and run the SQL from the script above
3. This will:
   - Create the 'policy-documents' storage bucket
   - Set proper file size limits (50MB)
   - Allow PDF, PNG, JPG/JPEG files
   - Create RLS policies for secure file access

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Policy Document Upload
- Log in to the application
- Navigate to property wizard or document upload
- Try uploading a PDF or image file
- Should now work without RLS errors

### 2. Test User Profile Display
- Dashboard should show user's first name
- Settings should allow profile updates

### 3. Test AI Learning System
- AI operations should log learnings
- Claude Learning Dashboard should display data

## Error Resolution Status

| Error | Status | Resolution |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| policy_documents_extended 404 | ✅ Fixed | View created |
| recent_login_activity 404 | ✅ Fixed | View created |
| learnings 404 | ✅ Fixed | Table created |
| search_learnings 404 | ✅ Fixed | Function created |
| user_profiles 400 | ✅ Fixed | RLS policies corrected |
| policy-documents upload 400 | ⚠️ Pending | Run storage bucket script |

## Next Steps

1. Run the storage bucket creation script in Supabase Dashboard
2. Test policy document uploads
3. Monitor error logs for any remaining issues
4. If issues persist, check:
   - Authentication token passing in server actions
   - File upload service configuration
   - Browser console for client-side errors
