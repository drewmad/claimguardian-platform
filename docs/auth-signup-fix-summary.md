# Authentication & Signup Fix Summary

## Problem
The signup form at https://claimguardianai.com/auth/signup was not creating users due to:
1. Complex signup forms using a non-existent RPC function `link_consent_to_user`
2. Trying to access a `profiles` table that doesn't exist in the public schema
3. Middleware session validation errors affecting public routes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Replaced Complex Signup Form
- Temporarily disabled `MultiStepSignupForm` that depends on missing RPC function
- Created `BasicSignupForm` that uses only core Supabase Auth functionality
- Updated `/auth/signup` to use the basic form

### 2. Fixed Profile Table References
- Discovered that production uses `user_profiles` table, not `profiles`
- Updated signup form to use the correct table name
- Added proper error handling to continue even if profile creation fails

### 3. Created Test Pages
- `/test-auth` - Basic authentication status checker
- `/auth-test-complete` - Comprehensive auth flow testing
- `/test-signup-simple` - Already existed for simple signup testing

### 4. Created Utility Scripts
- `scripts/test-signup.js` - Direct Supabase signup testing
- `scripts/check-supabase-connection.js` - Database connection verification

## Key Findings
1. Supabase Auth is working correctly at the API level
2. Email confirmation is NOT required (instant account activation)
3. The database has `user_profiles` table instead of `profiles`
4. Multiple test accounts were created successfully

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Basic signup is now working
2. TODO: Create or fix the `link_consent_to_user` RPC function
3. TODO: Re-enable the multi-step signup form once RPC is fixed
4. TODO: Consider migrating to use `profiles` table for consistency

## Test URLs
- Production Signup: https://claimguardianai.com/auth/signup
- Production Signin: https://claimguardianai.com/auth/signin
- Auth Test: https://claimguardianai.com/test-auth
- Complete Test: https://claimguardianai.com/auth-test-complete

## Verification
The signup form should now successfully:
1. Create new user accounts
2. Allow immediate signin without email confirmation
3. Create entries in the `user_profiles` table
4. Redirect to dashboard after successful signup/signin
