| 5 | pgvector Embedding Layer | Stores 1 536â€‘dim embeddings for all text and images to enable semantic search and RAG. |
| 6 | Event Log `_events` | Immutable event stream that triggers downstream AI automations on `claim_update`. |
| 7 | Claim Concierge | Summarizes claim changes and next steps, delivering notifications to adjusters or homeowners. |
| 8 | Coverageâ€‘Gap Analyzer | Compares parsed policy limits with loss data to highlight underâ€‘insured areas and exclusions. |
| 9 | Costâ€‘Code Allocator | Reads NetSuite jobâ€‘cost codes and autoâ€‘assigns claim lineâ€‘items to correct GL buckets. |
| 10 | Semantic Search & Qâ€‘andâ€‘A | Chat agent that answers complex coverage queries via hybrid SQL + vector retrieval. |
| 11 | AIâ€‘Assisted Forms | Preâ€‘populates supplemental forms and flags inconsistencies using stored policy/claim data. |
| 12 | Image & Drone Damage Detection | Vision model that tags damage types and links annotations to relevant coverages and limits. |
| 13 | Privacyâ€‘Guard Masking | Redacts or tokenizes PII before any LLM prompt leaves the edge function. |
| 14 | Explainableâ€‘AI Audit Trail | Stores prompt, model version, and sources for every AI action for compliance review. |
| 15 | Agentic API Gateway | RESTâ€‘toâ€‘Assistant bridge allowing external systems to query project or claim data. |
| 16 | Prompt Registry & Versioning | Versionâ€‘controlled prompt store that autoâ€‘migrates vector indexes on updates. |
| 17 | Coverage Chat Assistant | Lets users ask plainâ€‘language questions about their policy and endorsements with clause citations. |
| 18 | Damageâ€‘Aware Claim Builder | Wizard that tags uploaded damage media, maps tags to coverages, and drafts claim packets. |
| 19 | Inventory Vision Pipeline | Generates structured contents inventory from photos or video, including object values. |
| 20 | Voice Note Transcriber | Whisperâ€‘based transcription with geoâ€‘stamps and policy linkage for field surveys. |
| 21 | Dynamic Policyâ€‘toâ€‘Damage Linking | Crossâ€‘references each damage item with applicable coverages, deductibles, and exclusions. |
| 22 | Instant Claim Packet Generator | Merges coverage, inventory, photos, and notes into a carrierâ€‘ready PDF. |
| 23 | Loss Timeline Visualizer | Graphical timeline of storm landfall, policy inâ€‘force dates, and claim events. |
| 24 | Proactive Coverage Gap Alerts | Monitors NOAA/FEMA data and warns homeowners of low coverage before a storm hits. |
| 25 | Explainâ€‘Back Prompts | Autoâ€‘drafts denial or approval explanations that cite specific policy language. |
| 26 | Live Compliance Guardrails | Inline checks that ensure AIâ€‘generated text follows Florida DFS claims guidelines. |
| 27 | External Partner Qâ€‘andâ€‘A Gateway | Scoped endpoint for contractors/vendors to query outstanding requirements or documents. |
