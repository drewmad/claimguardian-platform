## Features

### 1. Automatic Learning Capture

The system automatically captures:
- Task descriptions and approaches
- Mistakes and corrections
- Successful patterns
- Tool usage efficiency
- Performance metrics

Example learning:
```javascript
{
  task: "Optimize database query performance",
  mistakes: ["Used N+1 query pattern"],
  corrections: ["Implemented eager loading with includes"],
  learnings: ["Always check for N+1 patterns in loops"],
  patterns: ["query-optimization", "performance"],
  confidence: 0.92,
  impact: 0.75
}
```

### 2. Pattern Recognition

Shared patterns are automatically derived from multiple learnings:
```javascript
{
  name: "Parallel Tool Execution",
  category: "performance_optimization",
  description: "Execute independent operations in parallel",
  confidence: 0.95,
  impact: {
    timeReduction: 65,
    errorReduction: 0
  }
}
```

### 3. A/B Testing

Every optimization is validated through controlled experiments:
- Control group: Standard approach
- Treatment group: With learning system
- Metrics: Success rate, execution time, error rate
- Business impact: Time saved, ROI calculation

### 4. Automatic Threshold Tuning

The system automatically adjusts confidence thresholds based on:
- F1 score optimization
- False positive/negative rates
- Production performance data
- Safety constraints

### 5. Knowledge Sharing

Export and import learnings between teams:
```javascript
// Export
const exportData = await claudeKnowledgeTransfer.exportKnowledge({
  teamId: 'team-1',
  exportedBy: 'user@example.com',
  projectContext: { ... }
})

// Import
const result = await claudeKnowledgeTransfer.importKnowledge(
  exportData,
  { mergeStrategy: 'merge', validateSignature: true }
)
```

## Monitoring Dashboard

Access the web-based monitoring dashboard:
```bash
npm run claude:dashboard
```

Or visit: https://claimguardianai.com/admin?tab=claude-learning

Dashboard features:
- Real-time performance metrics
- A/B test results
- Learning application rate
- System health status
- Feedback metrics

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Pattern Creation

```javascript
claudeSharedPatterns.addPattern({
  id: 'custom_pattern_1',
  name: 'Custom Optimization Pattern',
  category: 'performance_optimization',
  description: 'Description of the pattern',
  problem: 'Problem it solves',
  solution: 'How to implement',
  confidence: 0.85,
  // ... other properties
})
```

### Manual Learning Recording

```javascript
await completeLearningSystem.recordLearning({
  task: 'Implement new feature',
  mistakes: ['Forgot error handling'],
  corrections: ['Added try-catch blocks'],
  learnings: ['Always implement error boundaries'],
  patterns: ['error-handling', 'defensive-programming'],
  confidence: 0.9,
  impact: 0.6
})
```

### Feedback Collection

```javascript
await claudeFeedbackLoops.collectUserFeedback({
  sessionId: 'session_123',
  feedbackType: 'positive',
  category: 'performance',
  description: 'Significant speed improvement',
  rating: 5,
  context: {
    taskType: 'optimization',
    learningEnabled: true,
    success: true
  }
})
```

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks:
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful task completions
- **Execution Time**: Average time to complete tasks
- **Learning Application Rate**: How often learnings are applied
- **ROI**: Return on investment from optimizations
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback scores and ratings

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check production metrics daily
2. **Export Learnings**: Weekly exports for backup and sharing
3. **Review Patterns**: Monthly review of shared patterns
4. **Threshold Tuning**: Let auto-tuning run for at least 1 week
5. **Feedback Integration**: Respond to user feedback within 48 hours

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Learning not being captured**
   - Check `CLAUDE_LEARNING_ENABLED` is true
   - Verify confidence threshold isn't too high
   - Check system logs for errors

2. **Poor A/B test results**
   - Ensure sufficient sample size (>100)
   - Check for external factors affecting performance
   - Review learning quality scores

3. **High false positive rate**
   - Run threshold tuning: `claudeThresholdTuner.autoTuneThreshold()`
   - Review recent learnings for quality
   - Adjust minimum confidence settings

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check system status
node -e "require('./apps/web/src/lib/claude/claude-production-monitor').claudeProductionMonitor.getProductionStatus().then(console.log)"

# View recent learnings
node -e "require('./apps/web/src/lib/claude/claude-complete-learning-system').completeLearningSystem.getAllLearnings().slice(-5).forEach(l => console.log(l.task))"

# Test threshold analysis
node -e "require('./apps/web/src/lib/claude/claude-threshold-tuner').claudeThresholdTuner.analyzeCurrentThreshold().then(r => console.log(r.recommendation))"
```
