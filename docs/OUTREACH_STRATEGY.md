We're currently demonstrating:
- 75% faster incident response coordination
- 60% reduction in emergency management costs
- Real-time multi-agency coordination

We have a live demonstration using Monroe County's hurricane response as a model. Could we schedule a 30-minute demo this week?

Best regards,
