# ClaimGuardian Future Roadmap

This document tracks long-term enhancement ideas and strategic initiatives for future development phases.

## üåé **Multi-State Expansion** (Phase 3 - Q2 2025)

### Overview

Extend ClaimGuardian beyond Florida to become a nationwide platform for property insurance claims assistance.

### Target States Priority

1. **Texas** - High hurricane/tornado damage, large property market
2. **California** - Wildfire/earthquake risks, high property values
3. **Louisiana** - Hurricane corridor, unique insurance challenges

### Implementation Requirements

#### State-Specific Insurance Regulations

- Research and implement state insurance codes and requirements
- Add state-specific policy types and coverage variations
- Integrate state insurance commissioner databases and regulations
- Implement state-specific claim filing procedures and deadlines

#### Regional Disaster Patterns

- **Texas**: Hurricane, tornado, hail, flood patterns
- **California**: Wildfire, earthquake, mudslide risks
- **Louisiana**: Hurricane, flood, subsidence patterns

#### Data Sources Integration

- Texas: County Appraisal District (CAD) property data
- California: County Assessor property records
- Louisiana: Parish property assessment data
- FEMA flood zone data for all states
- State-specific building codes and permit databases

#### Legal & Compliance Considerations

- State-specific legal requirements for insurance claim assistance
- Public adjuster licensing requirements by state
- Data privacy regulations (CCPA for California, etc.)
- State-specific consumer protection laws

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Add state-specific tables
CREATE TABLE state_regulations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  state_code VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL,
  regulation_type VARCHAR(50),
  requirement TEXT,
  effective_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE state_disaster_patterns (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  state_code VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL,
  disaster_type VARCHAR(50),
  season_start DATE,
  season_end DATE,
  historical_frequency DECIMAL
);
```

#### AI Model Training

- Train damage analysis models on regional building types
- Add regional weather pattern recognition
- Implement state-specific policy interpretation models

#### Edge Functions Updates

- Create state-specific data ingestion functions
