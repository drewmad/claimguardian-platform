## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
1. Go to [Supabase SQL Editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/tmlrvecuwgppbaynesji/sql/new)
2. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/sql/20250805_production_fixes.sql`
3. Paste into the SQL editor
4. Click "Run" to execute the migration
5. Verify no errors occurred

### Step 2: Monitor Vercel Deployment
The code has been pushed to the main branch. Vercel will automatically deploy it.
- Monitor at: [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/madengineerings-projects/claimguardian)
- Expected deployment time: 3-5 minutes

### Step 3: Verify Production Features

Once deployed, test these features on https://claimguardianai.com:

#### User Profile Check
1. Sign in to your account
2. Verify the welcome message shows your first name (not "Property Owner")

#### Admin Dashboard
1. Navigate to `/admin`
2. Verify the new sidebar navigation appears
3. Check that all menu items are accessible
4. Test the collapsible sidebar functionality

#### AI Cost Tracking
1. In admin, click on "AI Costs" in the sidebar
2. The dashboard should load (may show no data initially)
3. Use any AI feature to generate usage data

#### Policy Document Upload
1. Go to a property details page
2. Try uploading a policy document
3. Verify no RLS errors occur

#### Claude Learning System
1. In admin, click on "Claude Learning" in the sidebar
2. Verify the dashboard loads (test data should be visible)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Use Vercel's instant rollback feature to revert to the previous deployment
2. The database changes are backward compatible, so no rollback needed there

## Support
