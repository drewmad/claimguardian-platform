-- Basic seed data for ClaimGuardian
-- This file is referenced in config.toml and needed for proper startup

-- Create a sample user (will be handled by auth system normally)
-- This is just to prevent seed file errors during startup

-- Insert seed data can go here if needed
-- For now, just a comment to make the file valid
