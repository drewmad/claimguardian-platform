ClaimGuardian ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our web application and services (collectively, the "Service").

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### 1. Information We Collect

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Service includes:

**a. Personal Data:**
Personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, and contact information, that you voluntarily give to us when you register for an account or use the Service.

**b. Usage and Derivative Data:**
Information our servers automatically collect when you access the Service, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the Service. This also includes data collected through monitoring services like Sentry for error tracking and performance analysis.

**c. Financial Data:**
Financial information, such as data related to your payment method (e.g., valid credit card number, card brand, expiration date) that we may collect when you make a purchase. We store very little, if any, financial information. Otherwise, all financial information is stored by our payment processor (e.g., Stripe), and you are encouraged to review their privacy policy.

**d. Data from AI Interactions:**
We collect the inputs, prompts, and queries you provide to our AI features, as well as the output generated. This data is used to provide, maintain, and improve our AI services.

**e. Data from Third-Party Services:**
We may collect information from third-party services you connect to our platform, such as location data from Google Maps.

**f. Data from Scrapers and Public Sources:**
Our Service may involve scraping data from public websites or other sources. This data is used to enrich the information and features available within ClaimGuardian. We make efforts to only collect data from publicly accessible sources.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. ClaimGuardian operates independently without insurance company partnerships or third-party vendor relationships that could influence our advocacy for you.

Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Service to:
- Create and manage your account.
- Provide, operate, and maintain the Service.
- Improve, personalize, and expand the Service.
- Process your transactions and send you related information.
- Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience.
- Detect, prevent, and address technical issues and security incidents.
- Respond to your comments, questions, and provide customer service.
- Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.
- Provide AI-powered advocacy and claim assistance without conflicts of interest.

### 3. Disclosure of Your Information

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your information with insurance companies, third-party vendors, marketing partners, or any commercial third parties. ClaimGuardian maintains complete independence to advocate solely for your interests. We may share information we have collected about you only in these limited situations:

**a. By Law or to Protect Rights:**
If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others.

**b. Technical Service Providers:**
We may share your information only with essential technical service providers that directly support our platform operations, including payment processing (Stripe), error monitoring (Sentry), cloud hosting (Supabase, Vercel), and infrastructure services. We do not share your information with insurance companies, third-party vendors, or marketing partners.

**c. Business Transfers:**
We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

### 4. Data Location and Security

**Data Location:**
All your personal information is stored and processed within the United States. ClaimGuardian does not transfer your data internationally or store it outside US borders. Our cloud infrastructure (Supabase, Vercel) operates within US data centers.

**Data Security:**
We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
